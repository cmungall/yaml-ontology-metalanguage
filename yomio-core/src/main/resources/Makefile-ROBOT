##   This is a generic Makefile that can be incorporated into any OBO project repository and included in
##   a project-specific Makefile by adding the following to the top of the makefile
##
## include Makefile-OBO
##
##   (or you may want to place it after your `all` target)
##
##   Note that Make does not support includes over URLs, so it is necessary to first copy this into your project directory.
##   (and then `git add` etc). After doing this it can be synchronized like so:
##
## make regenerate
##
##   Currently the main purpose is to define some standard build targets, variables, and to provide a standard way
##   of obtaining the robot executable, e.g. for running in travis
##
